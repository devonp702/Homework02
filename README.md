## intro
- A size reactive website created using bootstrap.
- There are three pages of html, and one CSS sheet to make some broad style changes.
- Any copy pasting of code has come from getbootstrap documentation.
- Fonts taken from google fonts.

## notes
1. The contact me page is just filled out as a blank form. When I learn how, I'm planning on making it work.
2. ~~Gallery is eventually going to become my work portfolio, but for now just has a bunch of placeholder pictures.~~ Some gallery sites have been added!
