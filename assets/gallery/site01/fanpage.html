     <p>
         Dimmu Borgir are a symphonic black metal band out of Norway. 
         After forming in 1993, they have gone on to release 10 albums despite a 
         revolving lineup of changing members. <br>
         On this page I will be giving you a taste of their musical style, 
         and enough information to help you start exploring their discography.
    </p>
    <h2>Bio</h2>
     <p>
         Starting out with only three members, Dimmu Borgir have become one of
         the most well known metal bands out of Norway. Their first two albums are considered by purists
         to be the only true "Black Metal" albums in their discography. In the folowing releases, the band members began 
         to switch out one after another. With a steady flow of new artists to work with, the band began
         to expirement with more orchestral sounds, a more symphonic metal than their old sound. Many old fans accused them of selling out 
         as they became more and more widespread in both popularity, and in their range of musical creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        With each new album, the production value, and technical skills of the band keep getting better. They did away with the synthesizers, and began 
        recording and touring with orchestras, and choirs. With more intricate costumes, and theatrical  live shows, they bring some serious energy 
        to any venue they perform at. Through all of the changes, disagreements, and the ups and downs of being in a band, the only two members that have stayed 
        consistant are Shagrath and Silenoz pictured below.
